        <h2>It&apos;s the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h2>
        <p>
          Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
          staff, and patients themselves -- making you more productive, less stressed,
          and adding just a bit more joy inot your practice of medicine.

        <h3>It puts care at your command</h3>
        <p>
          You don&apos;t have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or
          bounce around five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls
          everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it.
          And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with
          every patient you see.

          &ldquo;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically
          on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. The right information
          is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages
          technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.&rdquo;

          <p>
            Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your entire
            patient panel, so you know who needs extra help and how best to give
            it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population with
            proactive interventions, and take comfort knowing you're a step ahead.

            doesn&apos;t seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously important
            questions. But I just couldn&apos;t get an answer from our old system!

          <h3>It automates performance improvement</h3>
          <p>
            Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand performance,
            but they aren&apos;t enough to improve quality and increase revenue day after day.
            Canvas automates quality protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus
            on more complex work only they can do.

            &ldquo;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as a complex as ever,
            to be honest I didn&apos;t know how we were going to keep up. We&apos;re a
            small practice and we don&apos;t have a big quality team or a group of coders
            to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my
            concerns around quality and revenue performance.&rdquo;
