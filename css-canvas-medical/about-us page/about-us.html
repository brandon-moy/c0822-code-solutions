      <p>
        Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable,
        intelligent tools to advance their practice of medicine -- and
        improve their day-to-day.

    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <p>
      Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have fallen
      dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality and efficiency
      of health care. Clinicians spend far too long at their computers. Workflows
      are overly restrictive. Valuable medical data is left unstructured.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their technology
      partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes are and science -- technology
      can help or hinder this craft. Working with clinicians across the country,
      we think we have begun to build something that helps.

      <p>
        Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna -- a
        family nurse practitioner -- sacrifice family time in the evenings to
        &ldquo;finish&rdquo; charting. It never ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrew knew that the answer wasn&apos;t to go out and do it alone. He Started
        to fill the gaps in his experience. Seven practicing clinicians formed the
        clinical advisory board -- rather than leave practice to work full-time with
        Canvas, they used and reviewed product changes in their practices. Our Medical
        Director, Dr. Zimmerman, joined whne he saw the potential of Canvas to help
        independent practices like his practice, Temescal Creek Medicine in Oakland,
        California. Julian joined Canvas after working at Medicare and seeing the failures
        of current technology to keep up with increasing regulatory demands without
        burdening clinicians. Joe and a world class group of software developers joined
        to accerlerate out ability to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improve
        the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting that completely
        eliminates the need for menus and pop-ups. The name of the company describes
        the charting experience -- it feels like a blank canvas where you can tell
        the patient&apos;s story and seamlessly completed notes, orders, and chart
        review on a single, unified screen. With seamlessly integrated population health,
        billing, and practice management, Canvas is a reimagined platform for the modern
        primary care practice.
