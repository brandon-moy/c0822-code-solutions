      <h4 class="section-header-text">Making the Decision To Switch</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined
        that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on
        invenstment. Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to
        make this determination one way or the other. We will provide access to a
        sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a feel for the platform
        as well as references to current customers to talk about their experiences.

      <h4 class="section-header-text">Interfaces and Community Integration</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community
        resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling
        your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds
        running. We&apos;ll also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers
        into CVanvas so that sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally,
        if interfaces with health information exchanges or other information
        technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we
        can deliver and when.

      <h4 class="section-header-text">Data Migration</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current
        data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise
        EMR databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics
        and information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively
        straightforward. While importaing clinical notes and documents is more
        challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity
        with a wide variety of EMRs.

      <h4 class="section-header-text">Training and Site Visit</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
        charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks
        prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
        management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
        team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on Implementation
        and training.

      <p class="section-text">
        Go-live is when you start using Canvas with reali patients in your practice.
        We will be with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your prefernce,
        to make sure everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once
        you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical
        micotemplates, setting up new automations, modifying practice management
        settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.

      <h4 class="section-header-text">Sustained Performance</h4>
      <p class="section-text">
        All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide
        support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not
        meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments
        back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offera MIPS
        guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
        everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be
        a long, productive partnership for us both.
